<h2>Convex Hull</h2>
<blockquote>The idea of this approach is to maintain a lower convex hull of linear functions. Actually it would be a bit more convenient to consider them not as linear functions, but as points (k;b) on the plane such that we will have to find the point which has the least dot product with a given point (x;1), that is, for this point kx+b is minimized which is the same as initial problem</blockquote><br>
